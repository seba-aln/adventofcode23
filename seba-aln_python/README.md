For python solution there's a runner that automates reading input data and selecting solution. Just run:

```
python solve.py --day={day} --set={1}
```

Where `{day}` is `int(1-24)`
and  `{set}` is one of `1, 2, test1, test2`

Make sure that in the `day` folder you have created files containing input with extension `.txt`
